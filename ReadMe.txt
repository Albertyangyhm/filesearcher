A program that reads input files and allows the user to:
1. Choose to have the program print every word that has appeared in the input files and also output in wich files each word appears in
2. Choose a word and the program will output wich files this word appears in
3. The extra driver allows the user to essentially do the same thing but with the added capability of printing out the a word's 
appearance in file names and directory names too
4. I accomplished the extra credit portion by adding two booleans that detect wether a word is a file name or a directory name, 
if the booleans are true, the program indicates this to the user


*There are no bugs that I know of
